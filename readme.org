* Boot React Native
Provides several tasks that helps integrate ClojureScript with the React Native packager and build process
** Why?
React Native and ClojureScript seem to be made for each other. Unfortunately, out of the box ClojureScript does not play nice with React Native.

Basically, trying to get them to work together leads to the following problems:
 * You have to set up the cljs compiler to use :optimizations :whitespace or higher - this leads to slow compilation (more than 30 seconds after each change on my PC)
 * boot-reload and boot-cljs-repl tasks do not work
 * You have to start up the React Native packager in a separate terminal

This library aims to fix all of the above. It:
 * Allows for builds with :optimizations :none - much faster builds, and 1-2 second rebuilds
 * Allows for integration with other cljs boot tasks - cljs-repl, reload, cljs-test
 * Provides tasks to auto start react native packager
 * Custom transformer for react-native to speed up builds significantly
 * Logging server to allow for capturing console.log output on command line
** How to use?
Simply add the tasks =(before-cljsbuild)= to your build pipeline somewhere before =(cljs)=, and =(after-cljsbuild)= to somewhere after =(cljs)=. There is an example in the example directory that illustrates this - here's the main task from the example:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(deftask dev []
  (comp (serve :handler 'mattsum.simple-log-server/log
               :port 8000)
        (watch)
        (reload :on-jsload 'mattsum.simple-example.core/on-js-reload
                :port 8079
                :ws-host "matt-dev"
                )
        (rn/before-cljsbuild)

        (cljs-repl :ws-host "matt-dev"
                   :ip "0.0.0.0")

        (cljs :main "mattsum.simple-example.core")
        (rn/after-cljsbuild :server-url "matt-dev:8081")
        ))
#+END_SRC

* Example App
There is an example app to demonstrate using this plugin.

To start it up:
 * Run =npm install= inside example/app
 * Run =boot fast-build= inside example
 * Install app on your phone/emulator (should be connected via adb) - =(cd example/app/android && ./gradlew installDebug "$@")=
 * Replace all references to matt-dev to your computer's hostname in build.boot
 * If using watchman you might have to restart it
